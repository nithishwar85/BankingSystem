This is a small project I built in C++ to understand how basic banking operations can be implemented using object-oriented programming and file handling.
The project is console-based and shows how features like account creation, deposit, withdrawal, and balance inquiry can work in a simple system.

Features:-

•Create a new account

•Deposit money

•Withdraw money

•Check account balance

•Save and update details using file storage

What I Learned?
1.How to use classes and objects in C++
2.Applying OOP concepts like encapsulation and abstraction
3.Working with file handling to store and retrieve account data
4.Building a project from scratch and debugging errors

How to Run

Clone or download the repository
Compile the C++ files using any C++ compiler (like g++ or Turbo C++)
Run the executable in the terminal/command prompt



Future Improvements

•Add password-based login system
•Support for multiple users at once
•Better UI with a menu-driven design
