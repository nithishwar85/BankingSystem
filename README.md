# Advanced Banking System (C++)

This is a small project I built in **C++** to understand how basic banking operations can be implemented using object-oriented programming and file handling.  
The project is console-based and shows how features like account creation, deposit, withdrawal, and balance inquiry can work in a simple system.  



## Features
- Create a new account  
- Deposit money  
- Withdraw money  
- Check account balance  
- Save and update details using file storage  



##  What I Learned
- How to use classes and objects in C++  
- Applying OOP concepts like encapsulation and abstraction  
- Working with file handling to store and retrieve account data  
- Building a project from scratch and debugging errors  


##  How to Run
1. Clone or download the repository  
2. Compile the C++ files using any C++ compiler (like `g++`)  
3. Run the executable in the terminal/command prompt  

Example:  
```bash
g++ main.cpp -o banking
./banking
