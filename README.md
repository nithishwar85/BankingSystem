This is a small project I built in C++ to understand how basic banking operations can be implemented using object-oriented programming and file handling.
The project is console-based and shows how features like account creation, deposit, withdrawal, and balance inquiry can work in a simple system.

Features

Create a new account

Deposit money

Withdraw money

Check account balance

Save and update details using file storage

What I Learned

How to use classes and objects in C++

Applying OOP concepts like encapsulation and abstraction

Working with file handling to store and retrieve account data

Building a project from scratch and debugging errors

How to Run

Clone or download the repository

Compile the C++ files using any C++ compiler (like g++ or Turbo C++)

Run the executable in the terminal/command prompt

Example:

g++ main.cpp -o banking
./banking

Future Improvements

Add password-based login system

Support for multiple users at once

Better UI with a menu-driven design
